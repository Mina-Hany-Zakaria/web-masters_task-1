Repairs Over Replacement

We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in mind. That's
why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a system before outright replacing
it, wherever possible - it requires fewer materials and is easier on the planet, as
well as your wallet! If another company tells you that your system needs to be
replaced, just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair it first.

Customer Care

We're here to help you with solar panel
installation in Devon and Cornwall. If
we were to sum ourselves up in a few
words, those would be "reliable,
honest and friendly." We find our
customers agree! We're with you from
the start of the project to the finish.

C-2------------------------------
Price

As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar
systems don't tend to come cheap.
Our aim is to make solar power
accessible to everyone, so we price
ourselves in a way that makes solar
energy more affordable. We're focused
on helping you and on helping the
environment, rather than on turning a
profit.

C-3----------------------------------
Sustainability

As we've said, we do this because we
truly care about the planet and about
seeing people embrace a greener,
more eco-friendly approach to power.
The world of green energy can be
jargon-filled and opaque, so we want
to help educate people on the big and
little things they can do to protect our
planet!
